  abstract = {Object detection in large-scale real-world scenes requires efficient multi-class detection approaches. Random forests have been shown to handle large training datasets and many classes for object detection efficiently. The most prominent example is the commercial application of random forests for gaming [37]. In this paper, we describe the general framework of random forests for multi-class object detection in images and give an overview of recent developments and implementation details that are relevant for practitioners.},

  abstract = {Deep convolutional neural networks have performed remarkably well on many Computer Vision tasks. However, these networks are heavily reliant on big data to avoid overfitting. Overfitting refers to the phenomenon when a network learns a function with very high variance such as to perfectly model the training data. Unfortunately, many application domains do not have access to big data, such as medical image analysis. This survey focuses on Data Augmentation, a data-space solution to the problem of limited data. Data Augmentation encompasses a suite of techniques that enhance the size and quality of training datasets such that better Deep Learning models can be built using them. The image augmentation algorithms discussed in this survey include geometric transformations, color space augmentations, kernel filters, mixing images, random erasing, feature space augmentation, adversarial training, generative adversarial networks, neural style transfer, and meta-learning. The application of augmentation methods based on GANs are heavily covered in this survey. In addition to augmentation techniques, this paper will briefly discuss other characteristics of Data Augmentation such as test-time augmentation, resolution impact, final dataset size, and curriculum learning. This survey will present existing methods for Data Augmentation, promising developments, and meta-level decisions for implementing Data Augmentation. Readers will understand how Data Augmentation can improve the performance of their models and expand limited datasets to take advantage of the capabilities of big data.}

  abstract = {Convolutional neural network (CNN) is an important way to solve the problems of image classification and recognition. It can realize effective feature representation and make continuous breakthroughs in the field of image recognition, but it needs a lot of time in the training process. At the same time, random forest (RF) has the advantages of fast training speed and high classification accuracy. Aiming at the problem of image classification and recognition, this paper proposes a hybrid model based on CNN, which inputs the features extracted by CNN into RF for classification. Since the random weight network can also obtain valid results, the gradient algorithm is not used to adjust the network parameters to avoid consuming a lot of time. Finally, experiments are conducted on MNIST dataset and rotated MNIST dataset, and the results show that the classification accuracy of the hybrid model has improved more than RF, and also, the generalization ability has been improved.}
