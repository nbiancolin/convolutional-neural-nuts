  abstract = {Object detection in large-scale real-world scenes requires efficient multi-class detection approaches. Random forests have been shown to handle large training datasets and many classes for object detection efficiently. The most prominent example is the commercial application of random forests for gaming [37]. In this paper, we describe the general framework of random forests for multi-class object detection in images and give an overview of recent developments and implementation details that are relevant for practitioners.},

  abstract = {Convolutional neural network (CNN) is an important way to solve the problems of image classification and recognition. It can realize effective feature representation and make continuous breakthroughs in the field of image recognition, but it needs a lot of time in the training process. At the same time, random forest (RF) has the advantages of fast training speed and high classification accuracy. Aiming at the problem of image classification and recognition, this paper proposes a hybrid model based on CNN, which inputs the features extracted by CNN into RF for classification. Since the random weight network can also obtain valid results, the gradient algorithm is not used to adjust the network parameters to avoid consuming a lot of time. Finally, experiments are conducted on MNIST dataset and rotated MNIST dataset, and the results show that the classification accuracy of the hybrid model has improved more than RF, and also, the generalization ability has been improved.}
