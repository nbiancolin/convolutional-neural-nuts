\section{Project Description}
\label{sec:project_description}

- motivations behind project
    - 87% of Ontario's land is crown land (mostly forests), and it is filled with many species of plant
    - mushrooms are a common type of plant that are difficult to identify, especially since some are edible and some are poisonous

- goal of project
    - Create a deep learning model that can classify mushrooms into their respective species

- why deep learning is a reasonable approach
    - mushrooms have a lot of visual features that can be used to classify them
    - deep learning models have been shown to be effective at image classification tasks

\section{Indvidual Contributions and Responsibilities}
\label{sec:individual_contributions_and_responsibilities}

- How team is working together


-project management software used to communicate/track results


-detailed list of what everyone has worked on, and what they will be working on
