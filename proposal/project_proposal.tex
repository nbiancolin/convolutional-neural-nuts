\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}

Fungi identification is an increasingly critical task, with implications in food security, industrial use, conservation efforts, and biosafety. However, visual and image classification of fungi is a difficult task due to the wide variety of species \citep{LuckingAimeEtAl.UnambiguousIdentificationFungi.2020}. This goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can accurately identify macrofungi (fungi with large bodies) based on their genus.

Broad applications of this model include identification in parks and other areas where humans may interact with nature. Deep learning forms a suitable choice for this task, as it constitutes a powerful and accurate method for image recognition and classification tasks, including in ecological settings \citep{SchneiderTaylorEtAl.PresentFutureApproaches.2019}.

We propose the use of the MIND.Funga dataset \citep{Drechsler-SantosKarstedtEtAl.MINDFunga.2023}, which has approximately 17 000 images of nearly 500 species of fungi. This dataset is well-suited for our project, as it is built primarily for use in deep classification models. Images are also curated to be of a high quality and are labelled by species.

Our code can be found at this \href{https://github.com/nbiancolin/convolutional-neural-nuts}{GitHub repository}.

\section{Background \& Related Work}
\label{bg_related}

Previous applications of fungi identification models have prioritized food safety and satisfaction. In Bangladesh, a country with a large mushroom production, a farming method was developed by \cite{RahmanFaruqEtAl.IoTEnabledMushroom.2022} using machine learning to classify which mushrooms are being harvested. This system intended to remove toxic species that may have grown in the same area as the target mushroom. \cite{WangZhengEtAl.AutomaticSortingSystem.2018} created an algorithm to identify disease, discolouration, freshness, as well as other factors contributing to the commercial quality of a white button mushroom.

Our software would sort these mushrooms into genera, which would assist in identifying different types of mushrooms instead of certain physical features. Keeping with the theme of food quality, in Taiwan, \cite{LuLiawEtAl.DevelopmentMushroomGrowth.2019} developed a system to determine how much a mushroom has grown using an image recognition model, which produces an estimate based on images from different times. This used a convolutional neural network (CNN) to provide these results, which will be similar to our model's architecture. In the Chinese province of Yunnan, \cite{H.ZhaoF.GeEtAl.IdentificationWildMushroom.2021} created a wild mushroom identification model that used a CNN to identify edible and medicinal mushrooms due to increasing popular interest in mushrooms.

Other field work includes smartphone applications for recreational use, like ShroomID, which details mushroom species, while providing a heatmap of its location and seasonality. This educational tool provides useful information about a mushroom, after it has been identified using a classification model \citep{.ShroomID.2023}.

\section{Data Processing}
\label{data}

Many species in the dataset have a relatively small amount of images associated with them ($<30$ images), which may be detrimental when training, testing, and validating our model. To mitigate this, we intend to group images into larger “buckets” corresponding to a higher level of taxonomic classification, i.e., grouping by genus instead of by species. This is a simple way to reduce the number of classes our model must be trained on, and to increase the amount of data to a sufficient amount that model features can be reasonably trained. Genera form an ideal way to group images together — biologically species of the same genus share many physical characteristics, and they share a root name (the first word in the species name), which enhances ease of processing. Existing literature \citep{HollisterCaiEtAl.UsingComputerVision.2023} also suggests that models trained to classify genera tend to have better accuracy and are less difficult to train than species-level classification.

Once we have performed this combination, any genera with less than 75 images will be discarded from the dataset. This matches the lower threshold of published ecological classifiers, like iNaturalist \citep{Shepard.LatestComputerVision.2022} or models trained on the ETHZ human dataset \citep{SchneiderTaylorEtAl.PresentFutureApproaches.2019}. It also matches what is considered by \cite{FarleyMehrotaEtAl.ImprovingYourModel.2024} to be the lower end of images per class to train a model without overfitting.

Additional data augmentation techniques will be applied to the dataset to increase the amount of data, to ensure a sufficient amount of data for training, validation, and testing. We will randomly apply geometric transformations described in \cite{ShortenKhoshgoftaar.SurveyImageData.2019} with preference towards rotations and noise injection.

\section{Architecture}
Since our project primarily involves images, we plan to follow a workflow similar to that described by \cite{S.RenK.HeEtAl.FasterRCNNRealTime.2017}. We will first apply a regional proposal network (RPN) that first isolates the macrofungi from the image. RPNs are convolutional networks that are able to identify regions of interest (proposals) in an image.

We will then apply a convolutional neural network (CNN) for detection and identification training. Prior literature \citep{BarreStoverEtAl.LeafNetComputerVision.2017} suggests that a CNN is best suited for computer vision classification problems, especially in ecology-related settings.

We also intend to use a stochastic gradient descent-based optimizer, as it is a common choice for training deep neural networks \citep{JamesWittenEtAl.IntroductionStatisticalLearning.2023}.

\end{figure}

\section{Baseline Model}
For the baseline model we are comparing our model against, we selected a random forest classifier model. Our goal is to identify several hundred species of macrofungi, making this a multiclass classification problem. Decision trees like random forest are generally suited for multiclass problems \citep{GallRazaviEtAl.IntroductionRandomForests.2012}. Other methods, like support vector machines, are generally suitable primarily for binary classification problems \citep{JamesWittenEtAl.IntroductionStatisticalLearning.2023}. 

We will compare the classification accuracy and training time for both models. The random forest model will be trained using the scikit-learn library with the same data and data processing steps as the neural network model, following the steps outlined in \cite{Shafl.RandomForestClassification.2023}.

Note: The tasks and their assignments may change, particularly when a major task requires splitting into smaller more feasible ones. 

We (the team) plan to tackle all the tasks listed in the table above individually, as all tasks are planned out and distributed individually with clear deadlines. If any member cannot complete their task(s) on time, they must inform the team at the earliest convenience. A team meeting will then be held to determine whether to reassign the task, extend the deadline, or remove the task if it is of low priority. Given the team’s extensive experience working with each other, we (the team) have gained mutual trust and can resolve any potential issues together.

Coding tasks have been distributed so members will work on completely different sections, then push their functions into the main program. In addition, there is a member in charge of function integration and solving merge conflicts to ensure we will not write over each other's code.

We (the team) aim to meet at least twice a week via Discord calls, where the team discusses progress, tackles issues, and brainstorms ideas. The current meeting time is Wednesday and Saturday at 9 pm (Eastern Time), though this may change in the future. Our team's main source of communication will be Discord, and all members will check and reply to messages at least once every 12 hours.


\section{Risk Register}
As with any large scale project, there are many associated risks:

\begin{itemize}
  \item What if a team member elects to drop the course?
  \item What if the model isn't training properly?
  \item What happens if there's scope creep?
  \item What happens during time crunches?
\end{itemize}

We are privileged to have been friends for over a year. We have respect for and have worked with each other in the past. We recognise that a group member dropping the course, while far from ideal, is a choice that is made for a reason. Should such a case occur, we will meet and discuss how extra work will be divided and make a plan to ensure the project continues as planned with an extra workload.

We intend to avoid quality issues with the model by setting a timeline that leaves time for multiple rounds of iteration, further training, and debugging. If the model's performance is subpar, we intend to first make changes to the data processing and architecture. With a relatively small amount of data per class, deliberate improvements to both areas may be able to immediately improve performance.

As with many projects, this proposal was written with the understanding that circumstances may change as the semester continues. If left unchecked, project requirements can change drastically from the original proposal. We will keep this in mind as we discuss and work on the project to avoid any misconceptions.

Finally, we have experienced many short time constraints in previous projects and understand how they may affect the quality of the final product. The timeline we intend to set leaves extra room for unexpected issues. Should a time crunch occur, we will evaluate our responsibilities and progress and work according to a priority queue.
